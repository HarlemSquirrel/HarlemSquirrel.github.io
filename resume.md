![Me at Watkins Glen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarlemSquirrel/kevin_mccormack/master/assets/images/me_watkins_glen.jpg){: .resume-pic }
Since 2016 I have built, deployed, and maintained API and full stack web applications on Heroku, AWS, Digital Ocean, and on-premise servers. I document my work in detail, use Git for version control, and am comfortable in GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab. I believe that every application should have a comprehensive test suite with continuous integration including static analysis for code quality and security.

I am a big fan of open source software. I have a number of my own projects on GitHub and contribute to other projects when I can such as [home-assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), [ActiveLdap](https://github.com/activeldap/activeldap/), [AmazingPrint](https://github.com/amazing-print/amazing_print/), and [Net::LDAP](https://github.com/ruby-ldap/ruby-net-ldap).
